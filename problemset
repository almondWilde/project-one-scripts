Problem Scenario 4
create a partition,index,View for the scenario3.

	Solution:
		partition:
			set hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode=nonstrict;
			create table bevbranch(beverage String) partitioned by (branch String) location '/user/wk/projectone/scenario3_part';
			load data inpath '/user/wk/projectone/Bevs.txt' overwrite into table bevbranchpartition(branch);


		index:
			hive> create index s4 on table bevbranch (branch) as 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.index.compact.CompactIndexHandler' with deferred rebuild;
		view:
			hive> create view bevbranch010810 as select distinct beverage from bevbranch where (branch="Branch10" or branch="Branch8" or branch="Branch1");
			hive> select * from bevbranch010810


Problem Scenario 5
Alter the table properties to add "note","comment"

	Solution:
		note:
			hive> alter table stats set tblproperties ('note'='shows sum of orders on a certain beverage');
			hive> alter table bevbranch set tblproperties ('note'='beverages and the branches they are available in');
		comment:
			hive> alter table bevbranch set tblproperties ('comment'='vague data points, good luck deciphering');
			hive> alter table stats set tblproperties ('comment'='good data, lets use this for production');

			Answer:
				hive> show tblproperties bevbranch;                                                 OK

Problem Scenario 6
Remove the row 5 from the output of Scenario 1
	Solution:
		//Performed not on Scenario 1
		//view created for this scenario
		s6 table:
			Special_Lite    Branch6
			Double_cappuccino       Branch5
			SMALL_Coffee    Branch7
			LARGE_Espresso  Branch3
			Triple_Lite     Branch8 				<-target
			MED_LATTE       Branch6
			ICY_cappuccino  Branch5
			Cold_Espresso   Branch7
			Mild_cappuccino Branch3
			Special_cappuccino      Branch8


		hive> insert overwrite table s6 (select beverage, branch from (select *, row_number() over() as row_number from s6) as serialized_s6 where row_number != 5);

		Result:
			Special_Lite    Branch6
			Double_cappuccino       Branch5
			SMALL_Coffee    Branch7
			LARGE_Espresso  Branch3					<-old 4th
